# SocialSync 🤝

An app to track friend group interactions over time.

## Project Structure (The "Senior Engineer" Layout)

- `src/app`: The main "brains" of the website (Routes and Pages).
- `src/components`: UI pieces (Buttons, Cards, Navbars).
- `src/lib`: Connections to external tools (like Supabase).
- `src/types`: The "rules" for our data (What a "User" or "Group" looks like).
- `src/hooks`: Custom shortcuts for complex logic.

## How to Run

1.  Make sure you have Node.js installed.
2.  Install dependencies: `npm install`
3.  Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4.  Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Next Step
We need to connect to **Supabase** to store our data.
